## Motivation:

I believe that the ultimate goal of data science will always be to generate feedback for society, thus the use of this science in healthcare fields is an extremely important topic and has several relevant readings and uses for society. In light of this, while studying the field of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) further, I decided to seek a source of data in the healthcare field to create a data science project.

## Goals:

Cardio Vascular Disease its a relevant data source that relates risk factors and cardiovascular disease. Facing the fact that, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the world, causing the death of about 17.7 million people every year, I chose this dataset to develop an exploratory analysis.
The dataset used is called **Cardio Vascular Disease dataset** and the project created was based on implementing an exploratory analysis aiming to demonstrate and provide insights about different variables related to the presence of heart diseases in the analyzed patients. 
To achieve this goal, I used the programming language **Python**, libraries for data analysis such as **pandas** and **numpy** and for graphical visualization I used mainly the libraries **matplotlib** and **seaborn**. 

Furthermore, the main goal of the project was to use a **Classification Machine Learning Model** to predict whether the patient has (flag 1) or not (flag 0) cardiovascular disease, based on all his health parameters present in the dataset. The classification model chosen for the problem was the **Random Forest.**
